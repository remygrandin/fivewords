Awefully unoptimized but run in a few minutes on good hardware for ~ 10000 words

## How to run
 - clone/download this repository
 - run fivewords.exe (located in fivewords/fivewords/bin/Debug/net6.0/) in a commamd prompt on a windows machine (It will use the wordleWords.txt file and spit out what it find in the console.)
 - It should run from a handfull seconds to a couple minutes depending on you hardware (mostly your CPU cores and clock speed)
